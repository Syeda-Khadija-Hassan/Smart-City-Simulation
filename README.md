# 🌱 Smart Eco City Simulation Platform

Welcome to the **Smart Eco City Simulation Platform** — a C++ project that simulates building, managing, and growing a virtual eco-friendly city while learning about sustainability, resource management, and key OOP concepts through interactive gameplay.

 
---

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project aims to:

- Simulate an environmentally sustainable smart city.
- Educate users on eco-friendly practices using gamified mechanics.
- Demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as:
  - Classes & Inheritance
  - Polymorphism & Virtual Functions
  - Class Templates
  - Exception Handling

---

## 🛠️ Features

- **🏘️ City Building:** Add, upgrade, and manage residential, commercial, industrial, luxury, and social infrastructure.
- **🚴 Transport Control:** Implement eco-friendly transport options like bikes, buses, and EVs.
- **🌳 Environmental Activities:** Perform recycling drives, plant trees, and build energy systems like solar roads or dams.
- **👥 Citizen Actions:** Handle citizen feedback, protests, celebrations, and illegal resident deportations.
- **⚔️ Defense System:** Deploy units, defend against random threats (air strikes, cyber attacks), and perform special operations.
- **📊 Dynamic Stats:** Track eco score, money, population, events, and city logs.
- **💾 User Profiles:** Secure login/registration and persistent city state saving (via text files).
- **📚 Educational Tips:** Game events and feedback highlight sustainable practices.

## 🔍 Technical Highlights

- Fully implemented in **C++**, demonstrating strong use of:
  - Abstract base classes & pure virtual functions
  - Polymorphism via activity and transport classes
  - Templates (`Log<T>`) for activity history
  - Exception handling with custom `ActionException`
  - File I/O for user and city data persistence
- Console-based UI with colored output (using ANSI escape codes)
- Modular code organized with encapsulated responsibilities (e.g., social infrastructure, defense system)

## 🧑‍💻 Installation & Running

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- Windows or Linux terminal (supports ANSI escape codes)

### 📥 How to Compile and run

```bash
g++ -o eco_city_simulator test3.cpp

./eco_city_simulator  # Linux/Mac
eco_city_simulator.exe  # Windows
```
